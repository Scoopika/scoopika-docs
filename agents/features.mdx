The features Scoopika AI agents offer out-of-the-box:

## 1. Data validation

When your agent calls an external tool Scoopika validates all arguments the agent sent to the tool before executing it, and it auto heals invalid and missing data.

The same thing goes for when [using agents for data extraction](/agents/howto/extract-data).

## 2. Streaming hooks

Scoopika provides streaming hooks to capture spcific events in the agent process, like capturing each token the agent outputs in real-time. these hooks work on both server-side and client-side, and are so useful for creating a seamless, interactive, and fast experience. See [list of available hooks](/api-reference/hooks).

## 3. Auto healing

Agents will auto heal in case of invalid or missing data (for tools arguments), and if a tool fails or encounters an error while executing Scoopika will also auto heal it.
