## What are agents?

Agents are intelligent assistants powered by large language models (LLMs). You can customize them to specialize in specific areas, equipping them with tools, functions, and APIs. This enables them to perform actions or retrieve data based on the context of a conversation.

## What can agents do?

- Act as assistants for specific tasks, leveraging their tools to perform actions or retrieve necessary data based on the conversation.
- Extract structured JSON data. (see [structuredOutput](/packages/ts/scoopika/agents/methods/structured-output)).
- Collaborate in [Multi-agent smart boxes](/multi-agent-boxes) to tackle complex tasks.
- Serve as tools for other agents, allowing the primary agent to call the tool agent when needed (see [addAgentAsTool](/packages/ts/scoopika/agents/methods/add-agent-as-tool)).
- Perform actions on client-side in real-time like clicking a button ([learn more](/tools/client-side-actions))

## Create an agent

Once you've logged in, you can create a new agent [here](https://scoopika.com/app).

**Agent name**: Enter a name for your agent.

**Agent description**: Provide a brief description of your agent's functionality. This description is not the system prompt but helps when adding the agent to a multi-agent box or as a tool.

**Avatar**: Assign a visual identity to your agent by uploading an avatar or using the platform's avatar generation feature.

### Prompt the agent

Every agent requires a system prompt, which is a set of instructions guiding its behavior and task fulfillment. Click on "Add Prompt" to define a prompt for your agent. You can also choose the LLM that will drive this agent from the prompt editor options. Remember to provide the API keys for the LLM providers you're using within your code.

## Selecting the LLM

LLMs are the underlying technology powering your agents. You can choose from a list of available LLMs and providers within the prompt editor. Ensure you provide the corresponding API keys in your code for the chosen LLM providers when initializing a Scoopika instance ([see how](/packages/ts/scoopika/scoopika)).

<Check>API keys are securely kept on your servers and never shared with our platform.</Check>

## Run your agent

Scoopika agents are designed to run on the server side. We offer packages for both the server and client, supporting features like real-time streaming hooks and client-side actions out of the box.

### Web Usage (server-client)

To run agents on the client-side, you first need to add a route to your API that can handle everything related to Scoopika, and then be able to run the agents on the client-side. Steps:

1. [Scoopika for the web guide](/guides/scoopika-for-the-web): Setup your server-side and client-side.
2. [Agents client-side usage page](/agents/client-side-usage): Learn how to use agents on client-side.

### Server-side Usage

First install the server-side package:

```bash
npm install @scoopika/scoopika
```

Then initializing a Scoopika instance, the agent, and run it:

```typescript
import { Scoopika, Agent } from "@scoopika/scoopika";

const scoopika = new Scoopika({
	token: "YOUR_SCOOPIKA_TOKEN",
	engines: {
		openai: "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY" // Replace based on the LLMs providers you're using
	}
});

const agent = new Agent("AGENT_ID", scoopika);

(async () => {
	const response = await agent.run({
		inputs: { message: "Hello!" }
	});

	console.log(response);
})();
```

**Further Exploration**: For comprehensive server-side documentation, refer to:

- [Full Scoopika documentation for server-side](/packages/ts/scoopika).
- [How to use agents on server-side](/agents/server-side-usage).

**Utilizing Streaming Hooks (Optional):**

Streaming hooks allow you to capture specific events during the agent execution process. Learn more about hooks in the [API Reference](/api-reference/hooks).

Example with hooks:

```typescript
await agent.run({
	inputs: { message: "Hello!" },
	hooks: {
		onToken: (token) => console.log(token), // Capture every token the agent outputs
		onAgentResponse: (response) => console.log(response), // Capture the agent final response
		onError: (err) => console.log(err.error); // Capture errors
	}
});
```
