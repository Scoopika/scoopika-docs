For an introduction for what AI agents are what they can do, refer to [this page](/foundations/agents).

	**Prerequisite**

	1. Scoopika account. create one [here](https://scoopika.com/login).
	2. Scoopika access token. generate one [here](https://scoopika.com/settings?tab=tokens).

## Create an AI agent

Once you've logged in, you can create a new agent [here](https://scoopika.com/app/new-agent).

- **Name**: The name of the agent. agents are aware of their own names and their companions names.
- **Description**: Briefly describe the agent. notice that this is not the agent’s prompt, and only useful when using companions.
- **Avatar**: The agent’s avatar. only useful to display it.
- **LLM**: The large language model that powers the agent (its brain).
- **Prompt**: A set of instructions that the agent will act and behave based on.
- **Voice**: Select your agent’s voice. it will be used in voice-based interaction (we provide 2 voices options for now).

## Selecting the LLM

LLMs are the underlying technology powering your agents. 
You can choose from a list of available LLMs and providers. Ensure you provide the corresponding API keys in your code for the chosen LLM providers when initializing a Scoopika instance ([see how](/packages/ts/scoopika/scoopika)).

<Check>API keys are securely kept on your servers and never shared with our platform unless you add them to your account (optional choice).</Check>

## Run your agent

Before moving to your app, you can test your agent in the [playground](https://scoopika.com) (sepports both text and voice interaction).

<Check>
	**FUN FACT**

	The playground was built using Scoopika itself (with [Scoopika React library](/packages/ts/react) on the front-end).

Scoopika agents are designed to run on the server side. We offer packages for both the server and client, supporting features like real-time streaming hooks and client-side actions out of the box.

### Web Usage (server-client)

To run agents on the client-side, you first need to add a route to your API that can handle everything related to Scoopika, and then be able to run the agents on the client-side. Steps:

1. [Scoopika for the web guide](/guides/scoopika-for-the-web): Setup your server-side and client-side.
2. [Agents client-side usage page](/agents/client-side-usage): Learn how to use agents on client-side.

### Server-side Usage

First install the server-side package:

```bash
npm install @scoopika/scoopika
```

Then initializing a Scoopika instance, the agent, and run it:

```typescript
import { Scoopika, Agent } from "@scoopika/scoopika";

const scoopika = new Scoopika({
	token: "YOUR_SCOOPIKA_TOKEN",
	engines: {
		openai: "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY" // Replace based on the LLMs providers you're using
	}
});

const agent = new Agent("AGENT_ID", scoopika);

(async () => {
	const response = await agent.run({
		inputs: { message: "Hello!" }
	});

	console.log(response);
})();
```

**Further Exploration**: For comprehensive server-side documentation, refer to:

- [Full Scoopika documentation for server-side](/packages/ts/scoopika).
- [How to use agents on server-side](/agents/server-side-usage).

**Utilizing Streaming Hooks (Optional):**

Streaming hooks allow you to capture specific events during the agent execution process. Learn more about hooks in the [API Reference](/api-reference/hooks).

Example with hooks:

```typescript
await agent.run({
	inputs: { message: "Hello!" },
	hooks: {
		onToken: (token) => console.log(token), // Capture every token the agent outputs
		onAgentResponse: (response) => console.log(response), // Capture the agent final response
		onError: (err) => console.log(err.error); // Capture errors
	}
});
```
