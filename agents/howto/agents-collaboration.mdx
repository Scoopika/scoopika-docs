title: Agents Collaboration
---

You can have smart [multi-agent boxes](/multi-agent-boxes) where agents can collaborate on complex tasks, but there's another way to do it.

You can pass an agent as a tool to another agent. so the main agent can call the tool agent when needed based on context.

This feature is useful for when you have two agents and you want the first agent to use the other agents when it needs to.

## Usage

This feature is only available on sever-side as it's not needed on the client-side, and is easy to use:

```typescript
const agent1 = new Agent("AEGNT_ID-1", scoopika);
const agent2 = new Agent("AEGNT_ID-2", scoopika);

await agent1.addAgentAsTool(agent2);
```

Now agent1 will be able to call agent2 when needed. We recommend you give yours agents clear descriptions from the platform as its used by this method.
