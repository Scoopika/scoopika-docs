title: Equip Agents with Tools
---

You can equip agents with custom functions as tools so your agent can call these functions to perform actions or fetch data when needed based on context.

The process of adding a tool is simple, you define a schema for the arguments that your function expects so its sent to the agent and used by Scoopika to validate all arguments before seding them to your function.

The tool schema is just a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/).

Tool Schema example:

```json
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"query": {
			"type": "string",
			"description": "The search query"
		}
	},
	"required": ["query"]
}
```

The top-level property in your schema should be an `object` that has all properties under it.

Your agents can have two types of tools, server-side tools and client-side actions. the only difference between the two is that the agents calls a client-side action It's executed on client-side in real-time and its result is not sent back to the agent ([learn more](/tools/client-side-actions)).

Let's see a type-safe example of adding a too to an agent:

```typescript
import {
	createToolSchema,
	FromSchema,
	JSONSchema
} from "@scoopika/scoopika";

// Define the tool arguments schema
const toolParams = {
	type: "object",
	properties: {
		query: {
			type: "string",
			description: "The search query",
		}
	},
	required: ["query"]
} as const satisfies JSONSchema;

// Define the tool inputs type (from the tool parameters)
type ToolInputs = FromSchema<typeof toolParams>;

// Create the tool schema
const toolSchema = createToolSchema({
	name: "search_web",
	description: "Search the web for information",
	parameters: toolParams
})

// Define the tool function
function toolFunc(args: ToolInputs) {
	// Here args are validated and type-safe
}

// On Sever-side
agent.addTool<ToolInputs>(toolFunc, toolSchema);

// Or On Client-side (the same approach)
agent.addClientAction<ToolInputs>(toolFunc, toolSchema);
```
