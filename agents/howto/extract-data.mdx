title: Extract Structured Data
---

You can use agents to extract structured JSON objects from any data (text, audio, or images).

<Check>
	The examples shown in this page works just the same on both the server-side and client-side
</Check>

## Usage

All you need to do is define a zod schema of the data structure you want to get back,
the zod schema is then converted into a JSON schema and passed to the agent, 
it's also used to validate the agent's output... 
yes all agents outputs are not only typed, but also validated ensuring reliability.

Example usage:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const data = await agent.structuredOutput({
	inputs: {
		message: "My ID is u123, my number is 9^2, and I use Typescript",
		audio: [], // you can input audio files
		images: [], // you can input images (if the LLM supports vision)
	},
	schema: z.object({
		id: z.string().describe("The user ID"),
		number: z.number().describe("The user number").optional(),
		language: z.enum(["js", "ts"]).describe("The language the user prefers working with (javascript/typescript)")
	})
});

console.log(data.id); // string a 100%
console.log(data.language); // 'js' or 'ts' a 100%
console.log(data.number); // number or undefined because it's optional
```

the output of the above code would be this:

```json
{
	"id": "user123",
	"number": 81,
	"language": "ts"
}
```

## Validation

The data you get back is validated against the schema you provide, 
for now if the validation fails an error will be thrown, and we're working on better error handling for this case.

## Context-aware extraction

This is a really fun part, let's say that the user has an ongoing coversation with your agent in the session `session_1233`,
and you want to generate some JSON data to do some smart behavior or analytics in your app, well, it's as simple as adding one line of code:

```typescript
agent.structuredOutput({
	options: {
		session_id: "session_1233"
	},
	// the rest is the same
});
```

yes, you just add the session ID and the output will ne generative based on the conversation context.

For example you can extract a list of suggested messages that the user could ask next (suggestions) based on the ongoing coversation:

```typescript
const data = await agent.structuredOutput({
	options: {
		session_id: "SESSION_ID"
	},
	inputs: {
		message: "What could the user ask next?"
	},
	schema: z.object({
		suggestions: z.array(z.string()).describe(
			"A list of suggestions that the user could ask next based on the conversation"
		)
	})
});

console.log(data.suggestions); // string[]
```

Refer to [structuredOutput documentation](/packages/ts/scoopika/agents/methods/structured-output) for full docs.

## Limitations

Most LLMs can't perform well on complex data structures and nested objects, so it's recommended to keep
your schema as simple and clear as possible.
