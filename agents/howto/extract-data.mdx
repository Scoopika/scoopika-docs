title: Extract Structured Data
---

You can use agents to extract structured JSON objects from any piece of data. learn more about data extraction.

<Warning>This feature is currently only available on server-side, support for client-side is coming soon</Warning>

## Define schema

First, you need to define the schema of the data you want to extract. This is just a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) that's passed to the agent and also used to validate the agent's output... yes all agents outputs are validated ensuring stability and type-safety.

Example schema:

```json
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"id": {
			"type": "string",
			"description": "The user ID"
		},
		"number": {
			"type": "number",
			"description": "The user number"
		}
	},
	"required": ["id", "number"]
}
```

A data object that matches this schema would be something like this:

```json
{
	"id": "ID",
	"number": 1
}
```

## Type-safe Usage

So now let's see a type-safe usage example:

```typescript
import { JSONSchema, FromSchema } from "@scoopika/scoopika"

const schema = {
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"id": {
			"type": "string",
			"description": "The user ID"
		},
		"number": {
			"type": "number",
			"description": "The user number"
		}
	},
	"required": ["id", "number"]
} as const satisfies JSONSchema;

type Schema = FromSchema<typeof schema>;

const data = await agent.structuredOutput<Schema>({
	schema,
	inputs: {
		message: "The user ID is U123 and the user number is 123123123"
	}
});

// data is type-safe and validated here
console.log(data.id); // string
console.log(data.number); // number
```
