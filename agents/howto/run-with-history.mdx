title: Run With History
---

This guide shows how to run agents with history by using chat sessions.

First initialize Scoopika (or Client) and the agent. this works on both server-side and client-side.

In your server-side Scoopika initialization, you can pass a remote store URL that you can create [here](https://scoopika.com/app/data-stores) to have persistent chat sessions, otherwise Scoopika will use an in-memory store.

## Create session

Let's create a new session, in this case We'll create a session for a user with the ID "SCOOP" so we can then list SCOOP's sessions. You can use this approach to create sessions for specific users in your app based on their IDs.

```typescript
// On Server-side
const session = await scoopika.newSession({
	user_id: "SCOOP"
});

// Or Client-side
const session = await client.store.newSession({
	user_id: "SCOOP"
});
```

## Run agent

Now we can pass that session's id to each agent run to save the run to that session, example:

```typescript
await agent.run({
	inputs: {
		message: "Explain LLMs to me like I'm 5",
		session_id: session.id
	}
});
```

Notice that we passed the `session_id` as the session's ID we previously created, so now we can run the agent again and it will remember was we said earlier:

```typescript
await agent.run({
	inputs: {
		message: "What?",
		session_id: session.id
	}
});
```

## Get session runs

Now we can check that session's runs (history or messages, it contains the user request and agent response):

```typescript
// On Server-side
await scoopika.getSessionRuns(session.id);

// Or Client-side
await client.store.getSessionRuns(session.id);
```

## List user sessions

and we can list SCOOP's sessions, and it will return the IDs of sessions that SCOOP owns:

```typescript
// On Server-side
await scoopika.listUserSessions(session.id);

// Or Client-side
await client.store.listUserSessions(session.id);
```

## Delete session

You can also delete a session if you want to:

```typescript
// On Server-side
await scoopika.deleteSession(session.id);

// Or Client-side
await client.store.deleteSession(session.id);
```

See how easy and simple that is, history is managed for you, you just pass sessions IDs to runs!
