title: AgentResponse
---

`AgentResponse` is the object that the agent returns as a response after a successfull run.

## Props

An `object` with the following properties:

<ResponseField name="run_id" type="string">
  This field holds the unique identifier assigned to the specific run. It can be helpful for tracking and managing individual runs within your application.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="session_id" type="string">
  This field indicates the session ID associated with the run. The `session_id` plays a crucial role in maintaining conversation context across multiple runs within the same session.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="content" type="string">
	The generated text response.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="audio" type="AudioRes[]">
	The generated audio chunks. (if using voice).

	To understand what this is, you need to know how Scoopika generates audio. while the LLM is generating tokens, 
	it takes sentences and create urls to read them as audio in real-time, allowing streaming for better performance. the url is returned as the `read` property and can only be read once.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tools_calls" type="ToolHistory[]">
	A record of the called tools during the run and their results.
