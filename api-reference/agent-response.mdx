title: AgentResponse
---

`AgentResponse` is the object that the agent returns as a response after a successfull `.run` method call.

## Props

An `object` with the following properties:

<ResponseField name="run_id" type="string">
  This field holds the unique identifier assigned to the specific run. It can be helpful for tracking and managing individual runs within your application.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="session_id" type="string">
  This field indicates the session ID associated with the run. The `session_id` plays a crucial role in maintaining conversation context across multiple runs within the same session.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="response" type="LLMResponse">
  This property contains the core agent response, represented by an LLMResponse object (refer to [LLMResponse](/api-reference/llm-response)).

  The `response` object provides the LLM's generated text content and any external tools it called during processing.
