title: ContextInput
---

Used to define extra context you want the agent to be aware of.

## Props

<ParamField path="description" type="string" required>
    Describe what the data you're passing is about.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="value" type="string" required>
    The information you want the agent to be aware of.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="scope" type='"run" | "session"' required>
    The scope of the context. This will affect how and when the agent is aware of this info. here's a breakdown:

    **run**: The agent will only be aware of this info for this run, and the info won't be saved to its memory.
    This is useful for passing info that could change with each run, like for example the current date or the user's monthly plan.
    So it doesn't count to the LLM's context window each time.

    **session**: The agent will always be aware of this info in the next runs, and it will be saved to its memory.
    This is useful for passing info that you only need to pass once or not too often, like the user email or ID.
</ParamField>

        "value": new Date() // just example :)
    },
    {
        "scope": "session",
        "description": "The user ID",
        "value": "user_123"
