title: Inputs
---

`Inputs` is the primary input for running both agents and boxes through the `.run` method. It allows you to specify the message, history session ID, run ID, inject additional data, and pass variables to prompts..

## Props

The inputs can contain any key-value pairs, the main fields are:

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  The primary message to be sent to the agent for processing. This message becomes the latest chat message within the agent's context and the chat session.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="session_id" type="string">
  An identifier for the chat session. Providing a `session_id` helps maintain context across multiple runs within the same conversation. This allows agents to access previous history messages, enhancing its understanding of the ongoing interaction.

  > If this field is not provided, a new session with a random ID will be created for each run.

  > Providing a non-existent `session_id` will create a new session with the provided ID.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="run_id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the specific run. If you don't provide a `run_id`, a random one will be generated.

  This field can be useful for tracking individual runs within your application logic, particularly when interacting between client and server.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="save_history" type="boolean" default={true}>
  Determines whether to save the current run to the associated session's history.

  The default behavior is `true`, ensuring historical data is preserved.
</ParamField>


<ParamField path="plug" type="Plug">
  Used to inject custom data into the run.

  [Reference to Plug](/api-reference/plug)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Custom Key-Value Pairs">
  The `Inputs` object offers flexibility by allowing you to include additional key-value pairs beyond the pre-defined fields.

  This enables you to pass variables values to prompts within agents and boxes.
