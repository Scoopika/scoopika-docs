title: LLMResponse
---

The `LLMResponse` object is a core component of the response returned by an agent through the `.run` method. It encapsulates the text generated by the LLM and potentially additional information about the agent's processing.

## Props

<ResponseField name="type" type='"text" | "image" | "object"'>
  This field indicates the type of response generated by the LLM. Currently, Only `"text"` is being used, signifying a text-based response. However, there's a plan for supporting the other response types in the future depending on the evolving of Scoopika and the capabilities of LLMs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="content" type="string">
  This field contains the actual text content generated by the LLM in response to the provided prompt and session context.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tools_history" type="ToolHistory array">
  This array holds information about any external tools the agent used during its processing. Each element within the array represents a tool call and its corresponding result. The array can be empty if the agent didn't use any external tools for the specific run.
