title: Plug
---

The `Plug` is used to inject custom data into agent and box runs through the `.run` method's [Inputs](/api-reference/inputs). These custom data points can enhance an agent's processing capabilities.

## Props

<ParamField path="rag" type="string | function">
  This field facilitates the provision of custom knowledge for the LLM using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

  Can be one of:

  **String**: You can directly provide a string containing the custom knowledge.

  **Function**: For more intricate retrieval scenarios, define a `function` that accepts the current message context (`string`) as input. This function can either return a `string` containing the custom knowledge synchronously or a `Promise` that resolves to a `string` asynchronously.

  This field is intended to be used if you want to connect a Vector store to your agents. as it will be executed and sent the `message` from the run [Inputs](/api-reference/inputs), and then you can do anything with it, like getting relevant data from a Vector database.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="images" type="string array">
  This field allows you to pass a list of image URLs to the agent. The LLM driving the agent have to support vission (like latest GPT-4 versions), otherwise Scoopika will encounter an error.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="data" type="PlugData array">
  Additional information to the agent. Each object within the array has the following structure:

  - **description (string)**: A clear description of the data being provided so the agent understands what it's about.
  - **value (string)**: The actual data you want to pass to the agent.
</ParamField>
