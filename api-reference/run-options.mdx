## Props

<ParamField path="session_id" type="string">
  An identifier for the chat session. Providing a `session_id` helps maintain context across multiple runs within the same conversation. This allows agents to access previous history messages, enhancing its understanding of the ongoing interaction.

  > If this field is not provided, a new session with a random ID will be created for each run.

  > Providing a non-existent `session_id` will create a new session with the provided ID.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="run_id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the specific run. If you don't provide a `run_id`, a random one will be generated.

  This field can be useful for tracking individual runs within your application logic, particularly when interacting between client and server.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="voice" type="boolean" default={false}>
  Whether you want to agent to return an audio response along with the text response.

  Useful for voice-based interaction with agents.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="save_history" type="boolean" default={true}>
  Determines whether to save the current run to the associated session's history.

  The default behavior is `true`, ensuring historical data is preserved.
