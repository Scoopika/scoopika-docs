## What are Agents?

Agents are intelligent assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). You can customize them to excel in specific areas and equip them with tools, functions, and APIs to perform actions or retrieve data based on context.

## Creating Agents

You can visit the [Scoopika platform](https://scoopika.com/app) to create new agents, The process takes mere seconds. Once created, define a system prompt instructing the agent on how to interact and behave.

<Tip>See the [quickstart](/quickstart) to learn how to start running agents in your applications</Tip>

## Prompting Your Agent

A system prompt is a set of instructions guiding the LLM's interaction and behavior with users. Learn more about system prompts in [this page](https://promptengineering.org/system-prompts-in-large-language-models/).

## Accessing Agent Information

Use the `agent.load` method to retrieve information about an agent (name, avatar, description, etc.) within your application:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent("ID", scoopika);
await agent.load();

console.log(agent.agent);
```

Alternatively, use `agent.info` to obtain specific details:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent("ID", scoopika);
const name = await agent.info("name"); // Type-safe

console.log(name); // name is string
```
<Info>`agent.info` will load the agent automatically if it's not loaded yet</Info>

## Running agents

Once you have an agent instance, use the `agent.run` method to execute it. This method accepts an object containing `inputs` and `hooks`.

Explore these resources for further understanding:

- [Agent Run](/packages/ts/scoopika/agents/methods/run).
- [Inputs object](/api-reference/inputs).
- [Streaming Hooks](/api-reference/hooks).

Here's a basic example:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent("ID", scoopika);
agent.run({
	inputs: {
		message: "Hello"
	},
	hooks: {
		// Capture each token the agent outputs
		onToken: (token) => console.log(token)
	}
})
```

## Using on client-side

To use agents on the client-side We recommend you check the [Scoopika for the Web](/guides/scoopika-for-the-web) guide as It will walk you through how you can setup your server and client to run agents with streaming hooks on the client-side. It takes only a few minutes ;)
