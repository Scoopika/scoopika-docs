## What are Agents?

Agents are intelligent assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). You can customize them to excel in specific areas and equip them with tools, functions, and APIs to perform actions or retrieve data based on context.

## Creating Agents

You can visit the [Scoopika platform](https://scoopika.com/app) to create new agents, The process takes mere seconds. Once created, define a system prompt instructing the agent on how to interact and behave.

<Tip>See the [quickstart](/quickstart) to learn how to start running agents in your applications</Tip>

## Prompting Your Agent

A system prompt is a set of instructions guiding the LLM's interaction and behavior with users. Learn more about system prompts in [this page](https://promptengineering.org/system-prompts-in-large-language-models/).

### Prompts Variables

Incorporate input variables into your prompts, allowing you to pass information during agent execution. The prompt editor enables adding new variables. Specify their ID, type, and required status. Utilize them within the prompt using the `$variable_id` syntax.

When running the agent in your application, provide the variable's value within the inputs:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent("ID", scoopika);

const response = agent.run({
	inputs: {
		variable_id: "VALUE"
	}
})
```
<Info>
	Replace `variable_id` with the actual variable ID and ensure the value type aligns with the platform's specification.

For in-depth exploration of prompts and variables, refer to [this guide](/guide).

## Accessing Agent Information

Use the `agent.load` method to retrieve information about an agent (name, avatar, description, etc.) within your application:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent("ID", scoopika);
await agent.load();

console.log(agent.agent);
```

Alternatively, use `agent.info` to obtain specific details:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent("ID", scoopika);
const name = await agent.info("name"); // Type-safe

console.log(name); // name is string
```
<Info>`agent.info` will load the agent automatically if it's not loaded yet</Info>

## Running agents

Once you have an agent instance, use the `agent.run` method to execute it. This method accepts an object containing `inputs` and `hooks`.

Explore these resources for further understanding:

- [Agent Run](/packages/ts/scoopika/agents/methods/run).
- [Inputs object](/api-reference/inputs).
- [Streaming Hooks](/api-reference/hooks).

Here's a basic example:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent("ID", scoopika);
agent.run({
	inputs: {
		message: "Hello"
	},
	hooks: {
		// Capture each token the agent outputs
		onToken: (token) => console.log(token)
	}
})
```

## Using on client-side

There are two approaches to running agents on the client-side:

1. **API and Scoopika Integration**: Build an API and execute Scoopika under the hood, just like how you would use any other library. and handle client requests.

2. **Scoopika Server-Client Solution**: Leverage Scoopika's server-client solution. Install and run a Scoopika Server alongside our client library. This approach offers advantages like out-of-the-box streaming hooks and client-side actions.
