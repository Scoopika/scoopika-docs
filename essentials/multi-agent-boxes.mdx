    This page provides a high-level overview of Scoopika's Multi-agent Boxes (also known as Smart Boxes). For in-depth documentation, refer to the dedicated [Smart boxes documentation](/agents).
</Info>

Imagine a team of AI specialists working together! Multi-agent boxes are virtual containers that house multiple agents. The box intelligently selects the most suitable agent for the task in hand.

**Important Note**: Multi-agent boxes are currently a demo feature. However, you can still facilitate agent communication without them using the `agent.toTool` method. This method allows you to pass agents as tools to other agents, enabling collaboration. [learn more](/agent/toTool)

## Creating Multi-agent Boxes

You can visit the [Scoopika platform](https://scoopika.com/app/boxes) to create a new box, The process is simple:

1. **Name your box**: Give it a clear and descriptive name.
2. **Select the driving LLM**: Choose the Large Language Model that will coordinate the agents within the box.
3. **Assemble your team**: Select the agents you want to include from your existing agents.

## Initializing a Box Instance

Before you can utilize a box in your application, ensure you have [initialized a Scoopika instance](/initialize-scoopika-instance). Then, proceed with initializing the box instance:

```typescript
import { Box } from "@scoopika/scoopika";

const box = new Box("BOX_ID", scoopika);
```

## Running the Box

Running a multi-agent box follows a similar approach to running individual agents. However, box instances introduce additional functionalities through [streaming hooks](/box/streaming-hooks).

```typescript
const response = await box.run({
    inputs: {
        message: "Hello" // Required field for box inputs
    }
})

console.log(response);
```

## Tools

Multi-agent boxes offer the flexibility to equip agents with tools. You can add tools globally, accessible by all agents within the box, or assign them to specific agents.

```typescript
// Global tool (all agents)
box.addGlobalTool(toolFunc, toolSchema);

// Tool for a specific agent
box.addTool("AGENT_NAME", toolFunc, toolSchema);
```

For detailed instructions on creating tool schemas, refer to the [tools documentation](/essentials/tools).
