description: Integrate Scoopika into web applications
---

Scoopika focuses on being an ideal solution for web developers, by providing an easy way to setup Scoopika on the server-side by just adding a single route to your API, and using the client library with real-time streaming hooks and client-side actions supported out-of-the-box.

Scoopika should work with any web framwork that supports HTTP streaming, and We provide guides for integrating Scoopika with popular frameworks that you can find [here](/guides).

## Minimal Setup Example (Express)

Here's a minimal setup with Express:

```typescript
// Server-side

import { Scoopika, Container } from "@scoopika/scoopika"

const scoopika = new Scoopika({...}); // Replace with your scoopika config

const container = new Container({
	scoopika,
	agents: ["AGENT_ID-1"] // Replace with your agents IDs or custom setup function
});

// Add route to your Express API
app.post("/scoopika", (req, res) => container.handleRequest({
	request: req.body,
	stream: (s) => res.write(s),
	end: () => res.end()
}));
```

```typescript
// Client-side

import { Client, Agent } from "@scoopika/client";

const client = new Client("API_URL");
const agent = new Agent("AGENT_ID", client);

(async () => {
	const response = await agent.run({
		inputs: { message: "Hello!" },
		hooks: { // real-time hooks
			onToken: (t) => console.log(t)
		}
	});

	console.log(response);
})();
```
