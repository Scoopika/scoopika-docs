What are AI agents? what makes them different? how they work and why they're useful? Let's discover all these topics together.

## What is an AI agent?

You’re probably familiar with AI assistants like ChatGPT. These are platforms that allow you to interact with a large language model (LLM) in a chat-like interface.

In simple terms, an AI assistant is software built around an LLM to communicate with humans in a conversational manner.

So what the hell is an AI agent?

An AI agent is essentially an enhanced AI assistant with additional capabilities. Here's a straightforward definition:

1. **Takes Directions**: Can receive instructions from humans (e.g., perform a task, answer a question).
2. **Use Tools**: Has one or more tools to perform actions or retrieve data (e.g., call APIs).
3. **Autonomous Reasoning**: Decides independently how and when to use its tools to complete tasks, sometimes using multiple tools.
4. **Versatile Applications**: Can be used beyond conversational interfaces, such as for data extraction from unstructured data or generating structured outputs like JSON.
5. **Multimodal Inputs**: In Scoopika, AI agents can accept various input types, including text, audio, images, websites, and files.



In short, an AI agent is like an AI assistant on steroids. You can use any LLM capable of reasoning and utilizing tools (or function-calling) to create an AI agent with Scoopika.



## So what does Scoopika do?

Scoopika simplifies the creation of advanced AI agents around LLMs, offering features you won’t find elsewhere:

1. **Easy Development**: Scoopika provides all the tools needed for a seamless development process, making it simple to build interactive apps around AI agents.
2. **Built-in Error Recovery**: AI agents can make mistakes when calling tools, generating structured data, or handling complex tasks. Scoopika AI agents can self-recover from any errors they encounter.
3. **Multimodal Inputs**: Scoopika AI agents can accept various input types right out of the box, enabling the creation of advanced multimodal AI apps (accepted inputs include text, audio, images, URLs, and files).
4. **Managed History**: Scoopika offers managed serverless databases to store conversation histories, allowing you to build context-aware apps similar to how ChatGPT retains chat histories until deleted. This feature requires no additional code and is fully managed for you.
5. **Expand the Agent’s Knowledge**: When building AI agents or assistants, you often want them to understand more about your app or its documentation. Scoopika provides knowledge stores where you can upload files, PDFs, and websites, connecting them to your agent to access all the data so it has more knowledge from the sources you upload to the knowledge store.

And there's much more tools to discover along the way.
