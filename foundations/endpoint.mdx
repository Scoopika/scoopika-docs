title: Scoopika API Endpoint
---

To use Scoopika in web applications, both server-side and client-side, we recommend creating a Scoopika endpoint. This setup can be done in under 5 minutes.

## Why Create a Scoopika Endpoint?

Creating a Scoopika endpoint simplifies the integration process and enhances the functionality of your AI agents. Here’s why:

1. **Ease of Use**: Instead of managing HTTP requests and streaming responses manually, the Scoopika endpoint handles all communication between the client and server seamlessly. This makes client-side usage as straightforward as server-side usage.
2. **Enhanced Functionality**: The endpoint allows you to add tools to your agents from both the server and the client-side, unlocking a wide range of custom functionalities.
3. **Flexibility**: It works out of the box with any web framework, providing a versatile solution for various application needs.

## Benefits

A Scoopika API endpoint offers several built-in features:

- **Client-Side Usage**: Enables all Scoopika functionalities on the client-side, including agent interactions, data loading, and session management.
- **Server-Client Streaming**: Supports real-time streaming hooks on the client-side for agent response tokens, tool calls, audio, and other events.
- **Caching**: Caches agent data on your servers to improve performance and reduce load usage.
- **Client-Side Actions**: Allows agents to execute tools safely in the user's browser in real-time.

## Example usage (with express)

Here’s a simple example of setting up a Scoopika endpoint using Express

### Server-side

```base
npm install @scoopika/scoopika
```

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { Scoopika, Endpoint } from "@scoopika/scoopika";

// Setup Scoopika
const scoopika = new Scoopika(); // requires SCOOPIKA_TOKEN env variable
const endpoint = new Endpoint({
    scoopika,
    agents: ["AGENT_ID_1"] // List of agent IDs that can be used through this endpoint
});

const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // required middleware

// Define the Scoopika endpoint
app.post("/scoopika", (req, res) => {
    endpoint.handleRequest({
        request: req.body,
        stream: (s) => res.write(s),
        end: () => res.end()
    });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Client-side

```base
npm install @scoopika/client
```

```typescript
import { Client, Agent } from "@scoopika/client";

const client = new Client("API_URL/scoopika");
const agent = new Agent(client, "AGENT_ID");

(async () => {
    const res = await agent.run({
        inputs: { message: "Hello" },
        hooks: {
            onToken: (t) => console.log(t) // Streaming hooks
        }
    });

    console.log(res);
})();
```
