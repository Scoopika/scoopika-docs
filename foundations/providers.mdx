AI companies sush as OpenAI build LLMs (large language models) and provide access to them through their APIs.

in Scoopika, these AI companies are called providers. you can use a number of providers and LLMs with Scoopika, remember that each LLM has its set of capabilities, strengths, context window, and weaknesses.

In Scoopika, unlike some other platforms, we take a secure approach in using LLM providers, as you add your API keys on YOUR servers and never need to share them with us. see [Scoopika on your servers guide](/guides/scoopika-on-your-servers) to learn more.

Currently We support any LLM provider that's compatible with OpenAI's API, with support for more providers coming soon. if you need a provider that we don't support yet, cotact us at team@scoopika.com.

The LLM you use with Scoopika has to support function-calling and JSON mode, vision is optional.
