Streaming is one the most beautiful things in Scoopika, at least in my opinion :)

Instead of waiting for the LLM to finish generating the response, or for the agent to finish executing tools, we stream the events in real-time.

Scoopika provides +10 hooks to capture specific events during the agent process, like generated tokens, called tools, called tools results, audio chunks, and more.

This takes the agent response **latency from few seconds to few milliseconds**.

Streaming hooks work both on the server-side and client-side out of the box. example usage:

```typescript
{
    onToken: (token) => {...},
    onToolCall: (call) => {...},
    onToolResult: (res) => {...},
    onAudio: (audio) => {...}
}
```
