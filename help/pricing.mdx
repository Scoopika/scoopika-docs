## Pricing

We recommend you see the full pricing and FAQs [here](https://scoopika.com/pricing).

## LLMs Costs

Scoopika does not include LLM (Large Language Model) costs in its pricing.
You'll need to provide your own API keys for the LLM providers you intend to use with Scoopika.
Rest assured, your API keys are securely stored on your servers and never shared with Scoopika. [Learn more](/guides/scoopika-on-your-servers)

<Info>
    Your API keys are only shared with us if you add an API key to your account (optional), and all keys are 
    encrypted and never accessed by our team
</Info>

## Billing Cycle

Your monthly plan quotes always reset in the 1st of the month no matter of the date
you signed up for your plan.

## Scale

We're currently working to add a usage-based plan or a plan with scalable quotes.
this is still under planning and might come out during July 2024.
