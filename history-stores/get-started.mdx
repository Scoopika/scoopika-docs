## What are History Stores

Imagine a user interacting with your agent.. By default, Scoopika uses an in-memory store, 
meaning past conversations are forgotten on the long-term (stored in RAM only). 
History stores offer a persistent solution, allowing you to record chat history and enable your agents to 
access and reference previous interactions. This empowers your agents to:

**Maintain Context**: Agents can remember past conversations and user preferences, 
leading to more meaningful and personalized interactions.

**Improve Agent Performance**: Over time, agents can learn from past interactions, 
allowing them to provide more relevant and accurate responses.

## Create History Store

Scoopika Pro provides a user-friendly interface for creating history stores. Here's how to get started:

1. Go to the platform [here](https://scoopika.com/app/data-stores).
2. Assign a unique name to your store.
3. Click on "Create" to establish a new history store.

This will create a managed Serverless data store for you that's served edge-close to your users.

## Connecting your Store

Once your history store is created, You just need to add its ID when initializing Scoopika:

```typescript
import { Scoopika } from '@scoopika/scoopika';

const scoopika = new Scoopika({
    memory: 'STORE_ID'
});
```

By providing the history store ID to your Scoopika instance,
you instruct Scoopika to utilize this persistent storage for managing chat sessions and conversation history.
