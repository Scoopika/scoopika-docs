History stores are a powerful feature within Scoopika Pro that grants your agents long-term memory capabilities. By leveraging history stores, you can enable your agents to remember past interactions with users, fostering a more natural and engaging conversational experience.

## What are History Stores

Imagine a user interacting with your agent.. By default, Scoopika uses an in-memory store, meaning past conversations are forgotten. History stores offer a persistent solution, allowing you to record chat history and enable your agents to access and reference previous interactions. This empowers your agents to:

**Maintain Context**: Agents can remember past conversations and user preferences, leading to more meaningful and personalized interactions.

**Improve Agent Performance**: Over time, agents can learn from past interactions, allowing them to provide more relevant and accurate responses.

## Create History Store

Scoopika Pro provides a user-friendly interface for creating history stores. Here's how to get started:

1. Go to the platform [here](https://scoopika.com/app/data-stores).
2. Assign a unique name to your store. This name will be used as the store URL.
3. Click on "Create" to establish a new history store.

This will deploy a managed Serverless data store only for you.

## Connecting your Store

Once your history store is created, you can integrate it with your Scoopika instance on the server-side. Here's a code snippet demonstrating the process using TypeScript:

```typescript
import { Scoopika } from "@scoopika/scoopika";

const scoopika = new Scoopika({
	token: "SCOOPIKA_TOKEN",
	engines: {...}, // Your engines
	store: "STORE_URL"
});
```

By providing the history store URL during Scoopika instance initialization, you instruct Scoopika to utilize this persistent storage for managing chat sessions and conversation history.
