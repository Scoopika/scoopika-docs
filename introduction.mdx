## What is Scoopika?

Scoopika empowers you to seamlessly integrate intelligent agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) into your web applications. Our focus lies on providing a robust and secure platform that prioritizes:

1. **LLM Output Validation**: Ensure structured outputs and tool arguments adhere to defined types for enhanced reliability.
2. **Real-time Streaming Hooks**: Leverage over 10 hooks for real-time streaming of LLM responses between client and server, eliminating complex configurations.
3. **Error Auto-Healing**: Scoopika automatically handles errors, gracefully communicating any missing or invalid information to users.
4. **Flexibility**: Scoopika agents can ingest various data formats, including images, custom data structures, and RAG (response, action, and graph). You can also inject knowledge from Vector databases or other sources with ease. Support for audio and video is coming soon.
5. **Web-first**: Designed with web applications in mind, Scoopika offers libraries for both server-side and client-side development, along with real-time communication hooks and client-side actions for a seamless user experience.
6. **Ease of Use**: No prior LLM or machine learning expertise is required to build AI-powered applications with Scoopika. a base knowledge in JS (and TS for type-safety) is enough.
7. **Freedom and Security**: Scoopika's codebase is either open-source or source-available, giving you complete control. LLMs execute on your servers, and your LLM provider API keys are securely stored there â€“ never shared with us.
