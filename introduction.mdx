## What is Scoopika?

Scoopika is your go-to platform for seamlessly adding LLM-powered agents into your applications, prioritizing web integration, data safety, validation, developer experience, and flexibility.

Scoopika provides the following base features out of the box:

1. **LLM Output validation**: For structured output and tools arguments, with full type-safety.
2. **Real-time streaming hooks**: +10 hooks for streaming responses from the LLM. Works between client-server with no additional configuration.
3. **Errors auto healing**: If an error occures, Scoopika will auto heal communicating with the user about any invalid or missing information (in case of tools invalid inputs).
4. **Flexibility**: Scoopika agents accept plugged data, like images (if model support vission), custom data and RAG, so if you have a Vector database or want to send the agent any custom knowledge it's as easy as plugging the data into the run inputs.
5. **Web-first**: Scoopika focuses on being an ideal solution for web applications, providing libraries for both server and client side, with real-time hooks between the two, and [client-side actions](/client-side-actions).
6. **Ease of use**: No LLM or machine learning knowledge is required to work with Scoopika and build AI-powered applications.
