<Check>
	**Prerequisite**

	1. Scoopika account. create one [here](https://scoopika.com/login).
	2. Scoopika access token. generate one [here](https://scoopika.com/settings?tab=tokens).
	3. Scoopika setup for client-server usage. check this [guide](/guides/scoopika-for-the-web).
</Check>

Make sure you have a ready setup on your server-side and client-side before you continue with this page.

## Intialize

```typescript
import { Client, Box } from "@scoopika/client";

const client = new Client("http://localhost:4149/scoopika"); // Full URL to your API route that handles Scoopika functionalities
const box = new Box("BOX_ID", client);
```

## Run Box

```typescript
const response = await box.run({
	inputs: {message: "Hello!"},
	hooks: {
		onSelectAgent: (agent) => console.log(`Selected ${agent.name}`), // Capture when the box selects an agent to execute
		onToken: (t) => console.log(t) // capture each token any agent under the box outputs in real-time
	}
});

console.log(response);
```

## Access Box Data

You can load and access box data on the client-side:

```typescript
const boxData = await box.load();
console.log(boxData);
```

## Add Client-side Actions (Tools)

[Client-side actions](/tools/client-side-actions) are [external tools](/tools) that are defined and executed on the client-side. giving all agents under a box the power to execute actions on the client-side in real-time.

Notice that when adding a client-side action to a box, it's available to all agents under it, and can't be assigned to specific agents.

Notice that this page does not show how you can build a client-side action schema, check [Tools documentation](/tools) for that.

```typescript
const actionSchema = {...}; // Replace with your tool schema

function actionFunc = () => {}; // Replace with your custom function

box.addClientAction(actionFunc, actionSchema);
```
