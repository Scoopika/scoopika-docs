title: addClientAction
---

Allows you to equip your agents with external tools that the agent can call based on the context. 
these tools are defined and executed safely on the client-side without any insecure eval or code execution. [What are client-side actions](/tools/client-side-actions).

## Arguments

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  The name of tool. it has to be unique in the agent's scope.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string">
  Describe briefly what the tool does and when the agent should call it in natural language. make the description clear so the agent understands when to call the tool.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="schema" type="ZodSchema" required>
  A Zod schema that defines the parameters. It is converted to a JSON schema that is passed to the LLM, and used to validate the LLM tool calls.

  Recommended resources:

  [How to build my tools](/guides/how-to-build-my-tools)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="execute" type="Function" required>
	The function that will be executed when the agent calls this tool. it will be passed validated type-safe inputs based on the provided zod schema and will be executed on the client-side.
</ParamField>

## Behaviour

If you add more than 5 tools to an agent Scoopika will select the top 5 most relevant tools for each run based on the inputs.

<ResponseExample>
```typescript Example
import { z } from "zod";

agent.addClientAction({
	name: "sort_documents",
	description: "Sort the user documents",
	execute: ({ order }) => {...}, // action logic goes here
	parameters: z.object({
		order: z.enum(["asc", "desc"]).describe("The order to sort documents in based on date")
	})
});
```
