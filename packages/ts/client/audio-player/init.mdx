description: Used to play the audio agent response of a run
---

This is useful when implementing a voice-based chat interface with an agent, it can be used to play the agent audio response in real-time.

The voice [playground](https://scoopika.com/app/playground) you see in the platform was built using this.

## Initialize

This class takes one argument, an audio player HTML element:

<ParamField path="elm" type="HTMLAudioElement | string" required>
    Pass the audio HTML element or its ID.
</ParamField>

## Usage

Each audio player instance should only be used with one agent run, we're working to solve this issue. but for now you can just init a new player with each new run as shown in the example.

## Using with React

To use the player with React We recommend you use the [React library](/packages/ts/react) as it does everything for you under the hood. that's exactly how the Scoopika playground was built.

## Streaming

As you see in the example, we're using the `onAudio` hook to capture and play audio chunks in real-time while the agent is generating its response.

The `onAudio` actually doesn't receive the audio chunk itself, but a url to read the audio chunk as a stream, this url can be read once (because we don't store the data for security reasons). 

The audio player will queue the chunks for you and play them in the right order.

```typescript Example
import { RunAudioPlayer } from "@scoopika/client";

const player = new RunAudioPlayer("audio-player");

const run = async () => {
    // required for each new run
    player.newRun();

    const response = await agent.run({
        options: {voice: true}, // Enable agent audio response
        inputs: {message: "Hello!"},
        hooks: {
            onAudio: (audio) => player.queue(audio) // Queue audio chunks as we receive them in real-time
        }
    });

    // Optional: wait until all audio chunks are 'finished playing'
    await player.finish(response.audio.length);

    return response;
}
```
