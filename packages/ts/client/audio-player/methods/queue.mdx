description: Queue an audio chunk

Audio is streamed from the Scoopika endpoint while the LLM is generating tokens.

You can use the `queue` method along with the `onAudio` hook to play audio chunks in real-time.

<ResponseExample>
```typescript
import { RunAudioPlayer } from "@scoopika/client";

const player = new RunAudioPlayer("audio-player");

await agent.run({
    options: {voice: true}, // Enable agent audio response
    inputs: {message: "Hello!"},
    hooks: {
        onAudio: (audio) => player.queue(audio) // Queue audio chunks as we receive them in real-time
    }
});
```
