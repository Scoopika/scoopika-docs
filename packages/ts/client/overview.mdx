**Key features**

- Run agents and boxes on the client-side with real-time streaming hooks.

- Equip your agent with custom functions as tools that are defined and executed on the client-side. The agent will call these tools when needed based on context. These actions, documented in [client-side actions](/tools/client-side-actions), enable your agebts to perform tasks directly within the user's browser, such as simulating user interactions or manipulating the DOM.

- Manage chat or history sessions directly from the client-side. create sessions for specific user ID, list user sessions, get session messages or runs, and delete sessions.

- Easily implement a voice chat interface with agents, with built-in user voice recorder and real-time agent voice player.
