description: Used to make a user voice recorder with speech recognition
---

This is useful when implementing a voice-based chat interface with an agent.
It can be used to record the user voice and send it as input to the agent with 
built-in speech recognition.

The voice [playground](https://scoopika.com/app/playground) 
you see in the platform was built using this.

## Initialize

This class takes one optional options object with the following properties:

<ParamField path="onAudioChunk" type="(chunk: Blob) => any">
    A function that's called everytime a new audio chunk is read.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onStateChange" type="(state: State) => any">
    A function that's called everytime the recorder state change,
    available states:

    - **recording**: The recorder is currently recording.
    - **stopped**: The recorder is stopped or hasn't started recording yet.
    - **paused**: The recorder has started recording but it's paused.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onText" type="(text: string) => any">
    If in-browser speech recognition is support, this function will be called
    each time the recognized text is updated.
</ParamField>

## Controls

You have methods to control the recorder:

<ParamField path="start">
    Start recording.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="pause">
    Pause the recorder.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="resume">
    Resume the recorder.
</ParamField>

## Speech recognition

If in-browser speech recognition is supported, the recorder will use it,
and if it's not, the audio will be sent to the cloud to be recognized.

You can check if the recognition property is `null` to know if in-browser
speech recognition is supported or not:

```typescript
const recognitionSupport = recorder.recognition !== null;
```

You can use the asRunInput method to get the inputs to be passed to the agent,
this input will be built based on whether in-browser recognition is supported or not,
example:

```typescript
const inputs = await recorder.asRunInput();
```

If in-browser speech recognition, the inputs will be like this:

```json
{
    "message": "RECOGNIZED_TEXT"
}
```

Otherwise It will be like this:

```json
{
    "audio": [{
        "type": "base64",
        "value": "AUDIO_AS_BASE64"
    }]
}
```

You can pass the results of the `asRunInput` method directly to the agent like this:

```typescript
const inputs = await recorder.asRunInput();
const response = await agent.run({
    inputs
});
```

<ResponseExample>
```typescript Initialize
import { VoiceRecorder } from "@scoopika/client";

const recorder = new VoiceRecorder({
    onStateChange: (s) => console.log(s),
    onText: (t) => console.log(t)
});

// Start the recorder
recorder.start();

// Pause the recorder
recorder.pause();

// Resume the recorder
recorder.resume();

// Check in-browser recognition support
const recognitionSupport = recorder.recognition !== null;

// Get run inputs
const inputs = await recorder.asRunInput();
agent.run({
    inputs
})
```
