When initialized, returns a number of properties to check, update, and manage the state.

The main one is `newRequest` function that's used instead of `agent.run` to run the agent...
it takes the same arguments and provides better state management.

## Props

<ParamField path="newRequest" type="Function">
    Used to send a new message to the agent or run it. works the same way as [agent.run](/packages/ts/client/agents/methods/run).

    Returns [AgentResponse](/api-reference/agent-response) or `undefined` in case of errors. notice that the 
    `onError` was made to be used with this to capture any errors.

    If the agent is working and you call the `newRequest` before it finishes, it will wait until the previous run is finished before processing the new one.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="messages" type="RunHistory[]">
    A list of previous messages in the current session.

    [Reference to RunHistory](/api-reference/run-history)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="streamPlaceholder" type="AgentResponse | undefined">
    Used for streaming. while the agent is generating tokens and calling tools,
    this will contain the agent response while it gets updated in real-time.

    When the agent is not working this will be `undefined`.

    Please see [this page](/packages/ts/react/chat-state/streaming) to understand how it works.

    [Reference to AgentResponse](/api-reference/agent-response)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="generating" type="boolean">
    Wether the agent is generating tokens or not (working or idle).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="loading" type="boolean">
    Wether the agent is loading (started the run but still did not start to generate tokens).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="status" type="string | undefined">
    The agent status, if the agent is idle it's `undefined`, if loading it's `"Thinking"`, or if it's 
    calling a tool it's `"Talking with <TOOL_NAME>"`.

    You can use this to display the agent status directly to the end user.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="session" type="string">
    The current session ID.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="changeSession" type="(id: string) => void">
    Change the session. just provide another session ID, and it will load its history and update the state.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="loadingSession" type="boolean">
    When you provide a `session_id` in initialization or call `changeSession`, We need to load the session history (messages),
    and while the session history is loading this will be set to `true`, otherwise it's `false`.
</ParamField>
