## Installation

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @scoopika/react
```

```bash
yarn add @scoopika/react
```

```bash
pnpm add @scoopika/react
```

## Hooks

This package currently provides two main hooks:

- `useChatState`: Manages state for text-based interaction with agents, supporting streaming and tool calls.
- `useVoiceChatState`: Manages state for voice-based interaction with agents, 
including all necessary components for recording, speech recognition, 
agent voice playback, streaming, and a voice visualizer (like the one in GPT4-o).

<ResponseExample>
```typescript Hooks
"use client";

import {
    useChatState,
    useVoiceChatState,
} from "@scoopika/react";
```
</ResponseExample>

## Custom Hooks

These hooks are designed to simplify building chat interfaces like those in the [platform's playground](https://scoopika.com/app/playground). They handle the complete interaction cycle but may not be highly customizable.

We're working on more customizable hooks to be released soon. In the meantime, you can review the current hook implementations and create your own custom hooks. Check out the code [here](https://github.com/scoopika/react).
