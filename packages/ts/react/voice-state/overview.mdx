title: Initialize hook
---

The `useVoiceChatState` hook is designed for voice-based interaction with agents in your React application.

## Arguments

<ParamField path="client" type="Client" required>
    Your Scoopika client, initialized using [@scoopika/client](/packages/ts/client/client).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="agent" type="Agent" required>
    Your Scoopika agent, initialized using [@scoopika/client](/packages/ts/client/agents).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="options" type="Object">
    Configuration options for the state, 
    this can include all the [options available to useChatState](/packages/ts/react/chat-state/overview#arguments), 
    plus:

    - **auto_play_audio**: Automatically play the agent's audio response in real-time (defaults to `true`).
    - **agent_voice**: An object defining the settings for the agent voice player. 
    See [agent voice options](#agent-voice-options) for more information.

</ParamField>

## Agent voice options

These options are passed to the state options under `agent_voice`. 
If not provided, the agent's voice will not be played.

<ParamField path="audio" type="HTMLAudioElement | string" required>
    The audio element that the agent voice player will use to play the audio response.

    You can provide the element itself or its ID. 
    Typically, you'll create an `audio` element specifically for the agent voice player and pass its ID.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="canvas" type="HTMLCanvasElement | string">
    An HTML canvas element or its ID. If provided, the agent's voice will be visualized in real-time.

    The visualized voice will be drawn on the canvas. 
    The visualizer is similar to the one shown in the GPT4-o promotion videos 
    and is the same one used in the [Scoopika playground](https://scoopika.com/app/playground):

```typescript Usage example
import { Client, Agent } from "@scoopika/client";
import { useVoiceChatState } from "@scoopika/react";

// Better to move this to another file (e.g., scoopika.ts)
const client = new Client("API_URL");
const agent = new Agent("AGENT_ID", client);

export default function Component() {
    const state = useVoiceChatState(client, agent, {
        session_id: "SESSION_12345",
        agent_voice: {
            audio: "agent-voice-player",
            canvas: "agent-voice-canvas",
            wave_color: "#fff"
        }
    });

    return (
        <>
            <audio id="agent-voice-player" />
            <canvas id="agent-voice-canvas" width="600" height="400" />
