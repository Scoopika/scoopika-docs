description: Run the Agent
---

The run method is the primary way to interact with an agent. It initiates the agent's processing based on the provided inputs and returns the generated textual response.

<Tip>Agents can call external tools. check [addTool](/packages/ts/scoopika/agents/methods/add-tool)</Tip>

## Arguments

Takes one argument passed as an object with the following properties:

<ParamField path="inputs" type="Inputs" required>
  Specifies the input properties for the agent run. It should be an object adhering to the `Inputs` structure.

  [Reference to Inputs](/api-reference/inputs)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="hooks" type="Hooks">
  Allows you to provide a `Hooks object` to establish real-time communication channels with the agent during its processing.

</ParamField>

## Response

<ParamField path="response" type="Promise<AgentResponse>">
  The run method returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `AgentResponse` object upon successful agent run completion. This object contains the agent's generated response (always text-based) and other relevant information about the run.
