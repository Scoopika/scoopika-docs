title: load
description: Pre-load Box Data (Optional)
---

Allows you to optionally load the box data from the Scoopika platform before initiating any runs. By default, the box data is automatically loaded during the first run call. However, using load can be beneficial if you need to access the box data (such as its name and list of agents) before making the first run.

## Return Value

The `load` method does not require any arguments and returns the `Box` instance itself. You can then access the loaded box data using the `box.box` property, which holds an object of type `BoxData`.

[Reference to BoxData](/api-reference/agent-data)

## Behaviour

If the box can't be loaded from the platform It'll throw an error.
