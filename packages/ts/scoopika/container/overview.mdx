description: Handle API Requests
---

The Scoopika Container acts as a central component for handling API requests related to Scoopika functionalities, sent using the Scoopika client library. It's important to distinguish this container from Docker containers â€“ its purpose lies solely in managing Scoopika interactions within your web application's API.

The container provides built-in support for real-time streaming hooks, client-side actions, and caching to streamline your development process. It can be integrated with any web framework that supports HTTP streaming. We offer additional usage examples in the Guides section.

## Initialize

You can initialize a Scoopika container by passing it your scoopika instance, agents, boxes, and some other properties, see [Initialize Container](/packages/ts/scoopika/container/init) for full docs.

## Main Method: handleRequest

The Container class primarily exposes the [handleRequest](/packages/ts/scoopika/container/handle-request) method. This method handles API requests sent from the Scoopika client and routes them to the appropriate functionality within your Scoopika setup. It can handle tasks like running agents, boxes, managing chat or history sessions, and more. It takes the following arguments:

- `request`: An object containing the actual API request data sent from the Scoopika client (the request body).
- `stream`: A function that allows the container to send data back to the client in chunks, enabling real-time communication (HTTP streaming).
- `end`: (Optional) A function to signal the end of the stream. some web frameworks requires this to end the stream (like Express).

```typescript Example
// Full example usage with Express

import experss from "express";
import {
	Scoopika,
	Container,
	setupAgents
} from "@scoopika/scoopika";

const scoopika = new Scoopika({...});

// Basic setup
const container = new Container({
	scoopika,
	agents: ["AGENT_ID-1", "AGENT_ID-2"],
	boxes: ["BOX_ID-1", "BOX_ID-2"]
})

const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // required

app.post("/scoopika", async (req, res) => {
	await container.handleRequest({
		request: req.body,
		stream: (s) => res.write(s),
		end: () => res.end()
	});
});

app.listen(4049);
