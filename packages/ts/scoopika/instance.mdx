This page explores how to create a Scoopika instance, and the configuration options you can pass to a new instance.

## Props
Props are passed as an object during initialization.

<ParamField path="token" type="string" required>
  Your Scoopika access token. you can generate a new one [here](https://scoopika.com/app/settings?tab=tokens). Keep your tokens in a safe place and never expose them to the public. You can delete a token and it will delete its access to all of your data.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="store" type="string">
  Connect to a remote data store for persistent chat history storage. We offer managed serverless data stores you can create with a single click [here](https://scoopika.com/app/data-stores). Simply copy the store URL and add it as the `store` field.

  <Info>If this field is not provided Scoopika will use an in-memory store (data is not persisted).</Info>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="engines" type="object">
  An object containing API keys for the LLM providers your agents leverage. You can determine the host and LLM an agent uses from the agent's prompt editor. Currently supported providers include:

  - openai
  - fireworks
  - together
  - google (demo)

  Provide keys only for the LLM providers you actually use. If you run an agent that uses a provider that you don't provide a key for, Scoopika will throw an error.

  <Check>Your API keys are always secure and are never shared with our servers.</Check>
