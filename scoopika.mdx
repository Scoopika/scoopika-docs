## What is Scoopika?

Scoopika is an open-source toolkit and platform designed to help developers build reliable, fast, and multimodal LLM-powered applications with ease.  You can focus on your product while we handle the technical complexities.

Scoopika is not a managed service. Instead, we offer a TypeScript SDK and some hosted services for persistent memory and knowledge vector databases:

**SDKs**: Multiple SDKs to create AI-powered web applications and AI agents, packed with useful features. 
They work in your project independently, without needing to connect to our platform.

**Memory Stores**: Serverless, encrypted databases to store conversations between your users and AI agents (for chat-like apps). (hosted service)

**Knowledge Stores**: Serverless edge vector databases that allow you to expand the knowledge of any LLM from various sources like files, PDFs, or web pages.

Think of Scoopika as the beast mode of the Vercel AI SDK, designed to simplify and accelerate the development of LLM-powered apps without the technical hassle.

## Why use Scoopika?

Creating advanced multimodal AI-powered apps with Scoopika is straightforward and efficient. Hereâ€™s what makes it special:

1. **Validation**: Built-in LLM output validation with full type-safety and intelligent error recovery.
2. **Mutlimodality**: Easily handle multimodal inputs (text, audio, images, and website URLs) and generate text, voice, and JSON AI responses.
3. **Managed conversations memory**: Automatic management of messages and conversations with serverless encrypted memory databases. you just pass around sessions IDs.
4. **Knowledge stores**: Effortlessly expand any LLM's knowledge from your files, PDFs, or web pages using our hosted vector databases served on the edge.
5. **Real-time Streaming**: Build interactive AI-powered web applications with real-time LLM response streaming (text, voice, and tool calls).
6. **Flexibility**: Compatible with your server and LLMs, working seamlessly with any web framework.
7. **Web-first**: Specifically designed for web applications, empowering developers to build interactive AI features easily.
8. **Universal API**: Provides a universal API to run different LLMs from different providers.
9. **Affordable**: Use Scoopika for free on your servers. Scoopika doesn't send extra tokens to the LLM, so you get all its features at the same cost as running the LLM without Scoopika. Only pay for hosted features!
